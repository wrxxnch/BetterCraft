This mod is inspired by candles from another voxel game.

You can put candles in world, add remove or taint candles from an already existing node.

# How to

Add up to five candles in a node using candles from stack.

Remove them from world by digging candles in node one after the other.


## Minetest game / default
There is only one availabe item in survival, and one for all colors in creative.

Craft it:

* Require petz or/and bees mods installed
* Needs give privileges or creative server
* without those modes leaves and string will provide a backup for blue candle
** bad recipe as it is not supposed to be accessible in inventory

Colorize candles in world with dyes: one node needs 1 dye

### survival

you can add master candles item in any candle node without losing dying.

master candles is the only one you can get in inventory

### creative

you can any candles item in any candle node without losing node dying (you'll lose item dying).

### node names

node names are prefixed with the mod name

## Mineclone 2

Recipe depends on wip honey branch

Dying is done per candle

* in world if node contains only 1 candle
* from creative inventory via recipes

In world you can only add candles with same dying to a candle node

### node names

node names are prefixed with mcl_candles

#Requirements

* screwdriver seems to be somehow needed
* "farming:string" item is mandatory to offer recipe
* one of or both petz, bees mods to finalise the recipe

I tried to be game agnostic but it seems hard to achieve
