This Luanti mod adds leads which can be used for moving animals or
for tethering animals to fence posts.

Leads can also be attached between two fence posts for decoration.

Consider installing [Object UUIDs] to prevent leads from disconnecting from mobs when unloaded.


Instructions
------------

Right-click on an animal with a lead to attach it.
When you're finished, punch the lead to release the animal.

You can tether a leashed animal by right-clicking a fence post.
Punch the knot to take the lead back, or shift-punch to break it.

By default, leads can be used on animals, monsters, NPCs, players, and boats.
You can customise this in the settings.


Compatibility
-------------

This mod supports Mobs Redo, Creatura, VoxeLibre, Mineclonia, Repixture, and Exile.
Other games and mob frameworks may also work.

Luanti 5.5.0+ server required, Luanti 5.7.0+ client recommended.
If you want to support older clients, disable ‘Long selection box’ in the settings.
