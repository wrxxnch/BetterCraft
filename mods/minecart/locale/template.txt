Minecart Railway Buffer=
Summary=
1. Place your rails and build a route with two endpoints. Junctions are allowed as long as each route has its own start and endpoint.=
2. Place a Railway Buffer at both endpoints (buffers are always needed, they store the route and timing information).=
3. Give both Railway Buffers unique station names, like Oxford and Cambridge.=
4. Place a Minecart at a buffer and give it a cart number (1..999)=
5. Drive from buffer to buffer in both directions using the Minecart(!) to record the routes (use 'right-left' keys to control the Minecart).=
6. Punch the buffers to check the connection data (e.g. 'Oxford: connected to Cambridge').=
7. Optional: Configure the Minecart waiting time in both buffers. The Minecart will then start automatically after the configured time.=
8. Optional: Protect your rail network with the Protection Landmarks (one Landmark at least every 16 nodes/meters).=
9. Place a Minecart in front of the buffer and check whether it starts after the configured time.=
10. Check the cart state via the chat command: /mycart <num>@n   '<num>' is the cart number=
11. Drop items into the Minecart and punch the cart to start it.=
12. Dig the cart with 'sneak+click' (as usual). The items will be drop down.=
13. To retrieve lost carts, use the chat command: /stopcart <num>=
Primary used to transport items. You can drop items into the Minecart and punch the cart to get started. Sneak+click the cart to get cart and items back=
Used as buffer on both rail ends. Needed to be able to record the cart routes=
Protect your rails with the Landmarks (one Landmark at least every 16 blocks near the rail)=
Used to load/unload Minecart. The Hopper can push/pull items to/from chests and drop/pickup items to/from Minecarts. To unload a Minecart place the hopper below the rail. To load the Minecart, place the hopper right next to the Minecart.=

Minecart Cart=
Minecart Speed Signs=
If several carts are running on one route,@nit can happen that a buffer position is already occupied and one cart therefore stops earlier.@nIn this case, the cart pusher is used to push the cart towards the buffer again.@nThis block must be placed under the rail at a distance of 2 m in front of the buffer.=
Limit the cart speed with speed limit signs.@n@nAs before, the speed of the carts is also influenced by power rails.@nBrake rails are irrelevant, the cart does not brake here.@nThe maximum speed is 8 m/s. This assumes a ratio of power rails@nto normal rails of 1 to 4 on a flat section of rail. A rail section is a@nseries of rail nodes without a change of direction. After every curve / kink,@nthe speed for the next section of the route is newly determined,@ntaking into account the swing of the cart. This means that a cart can@nroll over short rail sections without power rails.@n@nIn order to additionally brake the cart at certain points@n(at switches or in front of a buffer), speed limit signs can be placed@non the track. With these signs the speed can be reduced to 4, 2, or 1 m / s.@nThe "No speed limit" sign can be used to remove the speed limit.@n@nThe speed limit signs must be placed next to the track so that they can@nbe read from the cart. This allows different speeds in each direction of travel.=
